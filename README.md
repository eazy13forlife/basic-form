* Colorful and fun

## My Process
*  I created the design on figma first. I was going for a clean and minimalit design and I figured it would make sense to use Fetch company colors. I also wanted to add some slight animations, which I was able to do for the input labels, slightly moving them up when a user types. I also added some transitions for the changing of the color indicators.
